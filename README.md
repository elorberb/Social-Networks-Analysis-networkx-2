# Social-Networks-Analysis-networkx-2
In this project we learned to find communities through modeling by graphs.
We received data from tweets made by knesset members to identify the Knesset members' parties according to the retweets they make to the other users.
We used community recognition algorithms to identify the political side of users.
We used Girvan Newman, louvain and clique percolation algorithms to identify the communities.
